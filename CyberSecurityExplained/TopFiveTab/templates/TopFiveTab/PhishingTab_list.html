                    <h3>Types of Phishing</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Email Phishing</li> Most phishing messages are email, and sent out by bulk. 
                        It usually attempts to replicate a legitimate business and will target other businesses as well as individuals.
                        Once a victim is compromised the access or information is sold on the darknet, or used as a starting point for other types of cyberattack.
                        
                        <li>Clone Phishing</li> Clone phishing is an email phish where a duplicate is made from a previous email sent to the target and replaces it with malicious links, 
                        to claim it is a resend of the email from the original sender.
                        
                        <li>Spear Phishing</li> Any phishing attack targeting a specific person of organization. These are tailored towards the targets, 
                        and may use names and addresses or other details to increase its believability. They may also be after specific information,
                        which may appear benign but open up new avenues of attack. When used against a CEO or high-profile target, it is referred to as Whaling.

                        <li>Voice & SMS</li> These attacks are performed the same as the above, but through automated voice or text messages. They may ask for senstive information,
                        or provide a link to follow. These may claim urgent action is needed for security, or harass a user into giving information.

                        <li>Page Hijacking</li> This attack targets a website and compromises it to redirect users to a malicious website. 
                        Typically, it will redirect them to a cloned version so that their login information or other sensitive information may be stolen.
                        <br>               
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col" >
                    <h3>How to identify Phishing!</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bad grammar or spelling</li> Most phishing targets large groups with many messages. They will be formatted with poor wording and not proofread.
                        These are focused on compromising as many targets as possible for the least amount of effort. If there are consistent mistakes in grammar or spelling, it is most likely an attack.
                        Some of this is because the attacks come from non-native English speakers, and some of it is to bypass spam filters by intentionally misspelling words.
                        
                        <li>Public email domains</li> If the email sender is from a domain like @gmail.com and contains special characters and numbers,
                        it is almost certainly a phishing attack. Most legitimate emails from a public domain will be based around a first and last name.

                        <li>Sense of urgency</li> Most legitimate messages will be sent to you with time to respond, something like 1-2 days or later.
                        Any message requiring immediate action and threatening some form of reprisal are most likely an attack.
                        
                        <li>Suspicious attachments or links</li> Hovering over links with a mouse will show the full link. If it is unrecognizable or does not match the content of the message, 
                        it could be a fake website to steal credentials or a way to install malware onto your device.
